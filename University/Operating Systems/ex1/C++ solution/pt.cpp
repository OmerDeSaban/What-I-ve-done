/**
 * @file pt.cpp
 * @brief The required pt.c file as a C++ file instead.
 * 
 * Number of page table levels = 5
 * We have 4KB = 4096 bytes in the entire page table structure.
 * Each entry consists of 64 bits = 8 bytes, thus there are 4096/8 = 512 entries.
 * log_2 (512) = 9, thus each level handles 9 bits of the virtual adress, and each phisical page number
 * takes up to 9 bits.
 * The virtual adress's first 12 and last 7 bits do not represent the virtual page number,
 * hence there are only 64-12-7 = 45 bits that do represent the virtual page number.
 * Therefore, there are 45/9 = 5 levels, indexed from 0 to 4.
 * Each level's bits are indexed as follows:
 * Level 0's bits are bits 12-20.
 * Level 1's bits are bits 21-29.
 * Level 2's bits are bits 30-38.
 * Level 3's bits are bits 39-47.
 * Level 4's bits are bits 48-56.
 * 
 * Useful identities:
 * (111 1111) base 2 = (127) base 10 = (0x7F) base 16. This is what the sign should be equal to, in bases
 * 10 and 16, when the 56th bit of a virtual address is 1.
 * (1 1111 1111) base 2 = (511) base 10 = (0x1FF) base 16. This is what the level bits would be equal to,
 * in bases 10 and 16, if they were all 1s.
